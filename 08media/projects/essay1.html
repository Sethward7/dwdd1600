            <p class="essay-title">Seth Ward's Non-Academic Capitalism Rant</p>
            <p class="essay-p">Modern capitalism negatively affects my life, and your life as well. Don't believe me? Capitalism is the reason we need jobs and go to school, which is all well and good. However, in recent times college has been getting insanely expensive, jobs have been increasingly harder to get, and when you are finally hired you willl be overworked and underpaid. In recent years, capitalism has been getting worse and worse for the majority of the world population, while the few prosper. I have  just been annoyed about this for a while, so here is my 1,000-1,250 words (4-6 pages) rant about modern capitalism (sources included!) </p>
            <p class="essay-p">I went outside today, took a look around, saw some beautiful mountains, some pretty trees, and a Walmart parking lot. This brings me to my first point, capitalism exploits and destroys the environment for profits. The human race is driving a car straight to our extinction, with the rich and powerful in control of the steering wheel and brakes. They could hit the brakes or swerve the steering wheel but that would make them lose some of their billions. In this analogy, the car represents the ongoing climate crisis, and the brakes and steering wheel represent sustainable practices. One of the most damaging practices to the environment is fossil fuel collection and consumption. As written by Sociologist William Carroll , “the corporations that dominate the fossil fuel sector and their predecessor firms are the major culprits…” whose “...investment decisions have directly caused the climate crisis and continue to exacerbate it” (Carroll). Fossil fuel companies are actively ruining the environment, however they are not the</p>

        <div class="page">
            <p class="page-number">Ward 2</p>
            <p class="no-dent">only problem. “The carbon majors are empowered by other actors that enable and legitimate fossil capital, comprising a "regime of obstruction" that protects the investments and revenue streams of fossil-fuel corporations and blocks meaningful climate action.” (Carroll) The corporations thrive off of ruining the environment and will continue destroying it until it is no longer profitable. </p>
            <p class="essay-p">It's not just environmental health we need to worry about, but us as well. While most developed countries have universal healthcare, the US does not. In this current system, if I make the decision to get hit by a car while riding my bike, goodbye $5,000 from my bank account. A study published by the New England Journal of Medicine, led by scientist Sara Machado, found that, “Across U.S. Census regions (Fig. S3), there appeared to be an increasing gap in survival between the poorest and wealthiest participants over the study period.”(Machado) So yeah, physical health in capitalism takes a backseat to those sweet sweet profits.</p>
            <p class="essay-p">If physical health is bad then mental health is very bad. Capitalism also fosters an environment of increased mental illness and rewards the potential hurting of the lesser fortunate. Working in a capitalist system is stressful. It especially does not help when you are being deprived of your material and psychological basic needs because everything costs money. There's also a feeling of being isolated, like you live on your own island, unable to have meaningful conversations with the people in your community and even your place of work. When you are focused on working so you can survive, you don't have time to build lasting relationships, romantic or platonic. There's also feelings of discrimination, people genuinely believe if you are different from them, then you must work differently and therefore be treated differently. People also tend to look up on the people who are financially successful and look </p>

            <p class="no-dent">down at the people who struggle financially, causing a separation between the wealthy and poor which is a perfect segue into my next topic.</p>
            <p class="essay-p">And finally inequality, the inherent separation between the wealthy and impoverished. This little thing is what got me interested in this topic in the first place. In 2024, the median income for an American household is $80,730 according to the US Census, and the top 1% richest Americans on average make $631,500 according to surveys run by dqydj.com. On average the top 1% make almost 8 times the median American household. That is an insane difference, and it only continues to grow. You have probably heard the saying “you gotta spend money to make money.” Well let me tell you, it is true. Here's the annoying part: when you spend more money you make more money, then when you make more money you can spend it and make even more, creating a positive feedback loop. A good example of this is investment intermediaries like mutual funds and hedge funds. According to the Journal of Corporation Law, “Wealth inequality feeds the growth of investment intermediaries and investment intermediaries, in turn, feed the growth of wealth inequality” (Winston).  Investment intermediaries are the quintessential example of the positive feedback loop that the wealthy thrive off. </p>
            <p class="essay-p">Overall capitalism has been detrimental to the average household because of environmental exploitation, decreasing overall health, and wealth inequality. The only people who thrive off of the capitalist system are the rich and successful. The rich love the capitalist system. When you are rich you get a lot of control of how things are run. If Jeff Bezos wakes up and decides that he will properly pay his employees and sell his products at a lower price, then his competitors will be forced to do the same. If congress is about to pass a bill the rich do not like, the rich can lobby congress to force the bill to fall short. Just because someone has more money that should not give them more rights. We are all human. We all have thoughts and </p>

            <p class="no-dent">feelings, dreams and goals, but this system treats people because of a number. Even though we are all human and should be treated equally, we treat other people better because they have a really nice car and house even if they used immoral and unethical practices to get ahead. I don't understand it.</p>
