        <p>Hello. My name is Seth Ward. <span class="montoya">You killed my father. Prepare to die.</span> Welcome to my portfolio. This is a place I can do dumb things with html, css, and javascript. Here you can find my current thoughts on how this project is going and a log of updates</p>

        <h2>Thoughts - <em>9/11/2025</em></h2>
        <p>Not using CSS is ROUGH, it makes it difficult to see the future vision of the site. Once I start with CSS, I'll be able to bring my ideas of fun and entertaining portfolio to life. The updates section of the site is a new and spur of the moment addition that will help me track my progress and keep my visitors informed.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Thoughts - <em>10/4/2025</em></h2>
        <p>CSS BABYYYYY! This is the reason I got into web development in the first place. CSS is the kind of thing I could work on for hours and never finish because there's always more that I could do. Now to get into the less fun stuff, I think its too purple. I love the color purple but purple doesn't always mesh with other colors. We'll see if I end up changing the colors a bit, but for now I'm just going to enjoy the process.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Thoughts - <em>10/22/2025</em></h2>
        <p>So, I've been doing images. Overall making the site look better. However, I'm going to have to redo the navbar. [EXPLETIVE] I did it. I think it looks better now.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Thoughts - <em>10/25/2025</em></h2>
        <p>I have no idea why this unit has been as difficult as it has. The nav bar sucked. My code did NOT want to cooperate, but it works. I made the concious decision to move the contact link with the other ones, but now the right side is blank. I don't know what to put there. My thoughts being, settings (for what, idk), a profile, or just a close the page button. In a previous project, it was a light/dark mode toggle, but that sucks to do. Maybe I'll link a random page or something idk.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Thoughts - <em>10/28/2025</em></h2>
        <p>I'm so tired. Its 10:30 pm and I just finished the contact form. I took a sick day today, and worked on this assignment for a couple of hours. I need sleep.</p>
